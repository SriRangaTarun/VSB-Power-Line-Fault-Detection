## VSB Power Line Fault Detection ðŸ”Œ
This is my work on the [VSB Power Line Fault Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vsb-power-line-fault-detection) on Kaggle. In this project, I created a recurrent neural network model (deep learning) to predict whether an overhead power line is faulty or not based on the voltage signals obtained from these power lines. This project would make it easier to detect faulty power lines quickly so that the concerned authorities can act faster and ensure the safety of the public.
