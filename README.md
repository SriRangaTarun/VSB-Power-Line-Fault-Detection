# VSB-Power-Line-Fault-Detection
This is my work on the [VSB Power Line Fault Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vsb-power-line-fault-detection) on Kaggle. In this project, I created a recurrent neural network model (deep learning) to predict whether an overhead power line is faulty or not based on the voltage signals obtained from these power lines. This project would make it much easier to detect faulty power lines quickly so that the concerned authorities can act upon it faster and ensure the safety of the people.
